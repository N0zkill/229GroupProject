#Design Document for Q3-ListAllElementsStack
The program uses a scanner to input 10 integers into a stack. 
From there, the new stack is cloned. 
To show all elements in the stack from top to bottom, we call the PrintStack method with our stack, StackRef. 
In the method, it saves the top of the stack via the peek method, prints out the top value, then pops it. 
It repeats this for the entire stack, showing all elements in the stack.
