#Design Document for Q5-ReverseStringStack
This program reverses a premade string and also a string that is inputted with the help of a scanner. 
How it works, is a new variable is made that is whatever is returned by the method reverseSentence and that is printed. 
We call reverseSentence twice, once for the scanned string and the premade one. 
In reverseSentence, an array of Strings is made, being filed by the given sentence called along with the method but split, as to fill the array. 
Then for each word in the array via for loop, we call another method, reverseWord, to actually reverse each word. 
We then append each reversed word as the for loop continues to return our final reversed string. 
The reverseWord method simply works by making a new stack for characters in the word, then pushing each character in the word onto a stack. 
After that, by appending the top of the stack to a new variable, reversedWord, which would be returned, we pop that character off the stack to continue until the word is backwards. 
Through this process, each word in the string would return reversed.
